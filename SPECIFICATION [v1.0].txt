# DMDice
 Dungeon Master Dice Roller

FUNCTIONALITY:  
	Accesses a URL served by AHART, which reads how many of each dice the user wants rolled for. 
	For example, in backgammon, you would want to roll two (2) D6 dice.  This function is specifically 
	designed to be used by D&D Dungeon Masters / Players, but can be used in many other gaming apps.

DEFAULT SYNTAX:
	public enum DMDice (
		D4    = 0, -- # of 4-sided dice to roll, default is 0 
		D6    = 2, -- # of 6-sided dice to roll, default is 2 for base "Roll" button functionality
		D8    = 0, -- # of 8-sided dice to roll, default is 0
		D10   = 0, -- # of 10-sided dice to roll, default is 0
		D12   = 0, -- # of 12-sided dice to roll, default is 0
		D20   = 0, -- # of 20-sided dice to roll, default is 0
		D69   = 0, -- # of 69-sided dice to roll, default is 0
		D100  = 0, -- # of 100-sided dice to roll, default is 0
		D1000 = 0, -- # of 1000-sided dice to roll, default is 0
	)
	returns a JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) object
	
DEV NOTE:		
	Expanded functionality in future would be to allow the user to set their own defaults for 
	just hitting "Roll" in the app. Maybe a DM likes to roll (3) 4-sided dice a LOT in their campaign.  
	They could set the default "Roll" button's action (request) to be (3) 4-sided dice. 

EXAMPLES:	
	public enum DMDice (D4=1,D6=10,D69=69) -- Roll (1) 4-sided, (10) 6-sided, (69) 69-sided and (1) 12-sided Dice
	
	returns the roll(s) for each dice type requested, via a JSON object. 
	
	In this case, JSON object would have three objects inside it named D4,D6,D69. Object D4 would have 1 roll 
	contained, D6 would have 10 rolls contained, and D69 would have 69 rolls in its container.
